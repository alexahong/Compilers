# Compilers

Partners: Alexa Hong and Jacob Mulligan

Alexa: I worked on implementing from_bin and getting the instructions into a vector.
Jacob: I worked on implementing the execution loop to get the correct value output.
Although we had seperate tasks, we helped eachother accomplish each task together.
