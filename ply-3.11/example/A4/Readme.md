IR assignment by Jacob Mulligan and Alexa Hong

for this assignment we chose to use python to implement our lexer and parser because python has easy to use libraries for lexing/parsing files.
The package we used was ply and the libraries we used were lex and yacc where lex lexes the .gpy file and tokenizes it and yacc parses the tokens and puts out the assembly instructions. we both collaborated on building both the lexer and parser but Jake focused more on the lexer where Alexa worked more on the parser.
